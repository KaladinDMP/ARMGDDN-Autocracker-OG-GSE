# ARMGDDN Autocracker Changelog

Welcome to the ARMGDDN Autocracker Changelog! Here, we chronicle the thrilling journey of our beloved program as it evolves and grows. Get ready for a wild ride filled with bug fixes, new features, and the occasional twist and turn!

## **v1.0.3 - 6/15/2024**
Today's update is a small one! We've squashed a pesky bug with the context menu icons and made some significant changes to the location of key files. Let's dive in!

**Highlights**
- Fixed an issue with the context menu icon for VD.bat not displaying correctly. Now, your context menu looks as polished as ever!
- Moved `nircmd.exe` to the `Resources/Tools` directory. It's now better organized and easier to find.
- Added `generate_interfaces_file.exe` to the `Resources/Tools` directory. Remember, you need to create the interface file on a legit Steam API DLL before using the autocracker on the DLL.


## **v1.0.2 - 6/12/2024**
A small but mighty update! We've ironed out some kinks from the previous version and made sure everything is running smoother than ever. Get ready for an even better ARMGDDN Autocracker experience! Sorry about the last update....


## **v1.0.1 - 6/11/2024**
Hold onto your hats, folks! v1.0.1 is here, and it's packed with more fixes than a handyman's toolbox!

**Highlights**
- We've given our exe files a fresh coat of paint and updated their version numbers. They're now ready to take on the world!
- ARMGDDN.Main, ARMGDDN.Cold.Client, and ARMGDDN.Autocracker have undergone some serious therapy to resolve their appid issues. No more falling back on old habits!
- Steam_appid.txts with old app id's have been shown the door. Out with the old, in with the new!
- We've tidied up the clears and pauses to make the flow as smooth as a baby's bottom. Readability is key, folks!
- Installing and removing context menu reg edits now come with a friendly warning about the talking. Adjust your volume accordingly, unless you enjoy surprises!
- Steamclient files in the Api folder have been given their marching orders. They weren't pulling their weight anyway.
- We've embraced the power of three and switched to the more common 3-number version code (X.X.X). Who needs that extra X anyway?

**Behind the Scenes**
- RAW files have been updated, and a shiny new dev branch has been created. It's like a secret hideout for all the cool stuff that didn't make it into the release version.
- We're dreaming big with plans for a database of games and non-games. Imagine a world where everyone contributes to a shared knowledge base, making the app faster and smarter! Also planning on a fork for [GSE fork](https://github.com/otavepto/gbe_fork) compatibility

**Shout-outs**
