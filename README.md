Welcome to ARMGDDN Autocracker! Because why waste your time figuring out which file to crack when you can let us sort-of-almost-kind-of do it for you?

ARMGDDN Autocracker is a cutting-edge tool designed to revolutionize the way you crack and prepare Steam games for an unparalleled gaming experience. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, ARMGDDN Autocracker empowers gamers and enthusiasts to effortlessly unlock the full potential of their favorite games.

**WARNING:** This is not a tool for newbies. Seriously, if you don't know what an EXE or DLL is, you might be in the wrong place. You'll still need to locate that stubborn EXE with its Steam stub, figure out the right Steam API DLL to mess with, and know when to throw in a Cold Client Loader or a VD bat. Oh, and if you don't know what any of that means... good luck!

## ✨ Features

### 🖱️ Context Menu Integration
Now, you can clutter your Windows Explorer with even more right-click options. Why do things manually when you can automate confusion with:

**EXE Files:**
  - **ARMGDDN Autocracker:** The buffet option—use one or many features, depending on your mood.
  - **ARMGDDN Cold Client:** For when you need to chill... or prepare your game for Cold Client Loader.
  - **ARMGDDN Steam Stub Remover:** Because Steam stubs are overrated.
  - **ARMGDDN VD Batmaker:** For all your Virtual Desktop (VR ONLY) needs—now in bat format!

**DLL Files:**
  - **ARMGDDN Autocracker:** Replaces your original Steam API DLL with the Goldberg Emulator. Fancy, right?
  - **ARMGDDN Steam Interfaces Maker:** Generates those lovely Steam interfaces for when you need to keep things OG (original DLL only, hope you kept it!).

### 🖱️ Drag and Drop Support
Why waste precious clicks when you can just throw your EXE or DLL onto the main executable and hope for the best? Remember: EXE fixes only on EXEs, DLL fixes only on steam_api DLLs. If you try to do both at once, prepare to face judgment (and an error).

### 🔍 Steam App ID Detection
ARMGDDN Autocracker will hunt for that elusive steam_appid.txt like a bloodhound. If it finds it, it’ll even copy it where it thinks it should go. If it can’t find it, you’ll get a polite nudge to enter the game name using our ARMGDDN.App.ID utility. And if that still doesn’t work, just type it in yourself. We believe in you. But not much, there is a tutorial video to watch if you need help.

### 🔓 Comprehensive Cracking
Forget struggling with Steam DRM—let ARMGDDN Autocracker do the struggling for you. You’ll still need a brain, but at least you won’t need 14 different tools to get one game running.

## 📖 Usage

1. Extract ARMGDDN Autocracker to its forever home (or just wherever you have space left).
2. Install the context menu commands with the magical *ContextMenuRegEdits.exe*. This does modify your registry, but hey, what's life without a little risk?
3. Or, skip all that and drag your file over to the executable like a true rebel.
4. Click around, follow the prompts, and pray it works.
5. If the steam_appid.txt is playing hide-and-seek, ARMGDDN will nag you until you provide the right info.
6. Bask in the glory of your cracked game library.

## 🛠️ Requirements

 - Windows OS (unless you like pain)
 - NET Framework 4.5 or higher (because old tech is boring)
 - A basic understanding of how to crack things (we’re not talking eggs here)
 - Common sense (don’t ask where to download that)
